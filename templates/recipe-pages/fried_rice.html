            <h2>Fried Rice</h2>
            <p>
              And although Chinese fried rice is a healthy option, it is loaded with lots of exciting flavors. Salty, umami, and savory soy sauce is balanced with spiced star anise,
               and raw scallions add a great pop of freshness you’ll love.

                A great vegetable fried rice recipe begins with well-cooked white rice. To do so, first, soak 1 cup of basmati rice (190 to 200 grams)
                 in water for 30 mins. Then drain and set rice aside.
              </p>
              <p>
                In a large pot add 4 to 4.5 cups of water, ½ teaspoon salt, and 2 to 3 drops of toasted sesame oil (or any cooking oil), 
                and set over high heat on the stovetop.
              </p>
              <p>
                Let the water reach a full boil.
              </p>
              <p>
                Add the soaked and drained basmati rice.
              </p>
              <p>
                Simmer the rice uncovered on medium to medium-high heat.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cook rice until al dente, or just about cooked. It’s important that you do not overcook 
                rice during this step in order to make the best Chinese fried rice dish.Overcooking rice or even cooking them completely, will break the rice grains while stir-frying.

              <p>
                Quickly strain rice in a colander, and let it cool completely at room temperature. Refrigerating rice for 30 minutes also helps. Simply cover cooked rice and refrigerate.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can also rinse the rice with water so that the rice stops cooking. Use your hands to gently stir the cooked rice grains around while rinsing to ensure that every grain is cooled. Then drain thoroughly.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now it’s time to stir-fry the vegetables. Start by heating 3 tablespoons of preferred cooking oil in a wok or a deep skillet. Add 1 whole star anise and fry for a few seconds, until the oil becomes fragrant.
              </p>
              <p>
                Add 1 cup water (or more or less as needed) and 1 tablespoon oil to make a thick yet smooth flowing batter. The amount of water 
                needed depends on the quality of flour, so start with 1 cup and add as required. Stir well to combine.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then add 1 teaspoon of finely chopped garlic, and ½ teaspoon finely chopped ginger. Cook for only a moment as you don’t want to brown or burn the garlic.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="single-instruction">

              </header>
              <p>
                Add the chopped spring onions, and sauté for a minute or two on medium-low to medium heat.
              <p>
                Then add the finely chopped french beans – or, add these before the onions if you want a softer bean texture.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now add the remain1ing finely chopped veggies, including mushrooms and celery. Increase the heat to high to thoroughly cook all of the ingredients.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once the veggies have cooked, add 1 tablespoon of soy sauce. Stir and mix well.
              </p>
              <p>
                Taste the dish, and then add ½ a teaspoon of ground black pepper and as much salt as you like.
              </p>
              <p>
                Mix well to combine the flavors.
              </p>
              <p>
                You are now ready to put everything together to make the veg fried rice. To the wok or skillet of veggies add the cooked and cooled rice – 1 cup or so at a time.


              </p>
              <p>
                Reduce the heat to medium or medium-high. Use a spoon or spatula to gently fold cooked rice into the mixed vegetables.
              <p>
                With the heat still on medium to medium-high, continue to gently mix and fry the vegetables with rice for a couple of minutes.
